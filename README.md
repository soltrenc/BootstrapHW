# BootstrapHW
The project was kinda tough, still getting used to learning the logic behind all of this.
All in all, I believe I've come a long way from where I started especially with this HW.
We needed to re-create our portfolio using Bootstrap and Bootstrap's styling. 
Using Bootstrap, I was able to place all my items from each of my html's pages and align them using Bootstrap's grid system.
Like I said, still getting used to learning that whole grid system so even my homework may not be completely where it needs to be.
Regardless, the pages needed to be responsive and interactive.
Using Bootstrap, I got a functioning navbar that works.
My portfolio page looks better than what it originally had while using an external style sheet I fixed the styling to be close to what it should be.
All in all, I'm just doing my best with these assignments and asserting myself to learning all of this as best as possible.
So far so good.
